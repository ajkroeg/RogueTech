It carries a Defiance 753 Heavy PPC, Defiance 250 Light PPC, and Poland Main Model A Gauss Rifle for long range combat. Should an enemy survive long enough to close with the 9S, it can utilize three Defiance E3M ER Medium Lasers and a single Defiance B3M Medium Laser. A TharHes Maxi SRM-6 can exploit weaknesses in an opposing unit's armor, while CASE keeps the ammunition from doing too much damage in the event of an explosion. In order to make room for all of these things, the XL Gyro of the 8S is also retained. Finally, a Targeting Computer improves the accuracy of all the weapons except for the missile launcher.",

The 55-ton 'Mech took seven years to design, as Coordinator Kozo Von Rohrs refused to open up the process to anybody but a select group at New Samarkand Armor Works (the predecessor of Luthien Armor Works) who were under constant surveillance by DEST. 2468 finally saw the GLD-1R Gladiator hit mass-production. Following the Battle of Nox in 2475, the dishonored 'Mech was retired from official production, with NSAW closing down the production lines by 2488. Merryweather Industries was the first private company to attempt BattleMech production without governmental support. Despite their location in the Terran Hegemony, they acquired the plans to the Gladiator and produced a new run in 2490. They were unable to raise the capital to finish their second run, the 4R, and nearly went bankrupt before moving into IndustrialMechs. The GLD-4R production lines were closed down in 2495. A few salvaged Gladiator -1Rs were still in service with militaries across the Inner Sphere and Periphery, though these relics were finally pushed to extinction during the Reunification War. The 55-ton Gladiator has a top speed of 86 km/h, comparable to many other 'Mechs of the same weight. Nine and a half tons of armor provides a respectable amount of protection. Five jump jets enables the 'Mech to jump up to 150 meters at a time.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.05.</color></b>",

      "content": "The Grigori is one of the Word of Blake's new Celestial series OmniMechs designed by Doctor Devon Cortland. The Grigori (named after fallen angels from Christianity) was added to the Word of Blake Militia's arsenal in late 3069 as Doctor Cortland oversaw the final production personally. It is constructed on a standard chassis, but makes use of eleven tons of Light Ferro-Fibrous armor, a light fusion engine, and an XL Gyro; as well as the small cockpit that is common to all of the Celestials. Like the other Celestials, the Grigori has a C3i Computer to help direct its fire. Another missile-heavy variant, the Grigori B mounts an Artemis IV-guided MML 7 in each arm. A Plasma Rifle provides respectable firepower and forces conventional units to reconsider attacking the Infernus variant. A Medium Pulse Laser provides a more accurate weapon. A rear-mounted ER Small Laser makes small units think twice about attacking the 'Mech's rear. Like the Invictus, this configuration can also jump up to 120 meters.",

As it is, the Ostcout would be hard-pressed to win a fight against all but the lightest 'Mechs. A poor combatant, the 'Mech excels at operating deep behind enemy lines, gathering as much information as possible about the terrain and the disposition of enemy forces. Besides the Great Houses, ComStar also utilized the Ostscout, and in the aftermath of the Clan Invasion and ComStar Schism began developing a new Ostscout variant for their Com Guards. This new model would maintain the same maneuverability and intelligence-gathering capabilities of the original while improving its offensive and defensive capabilities. Debuting with success in 3064, within the next three years nearly half of all Com Guard Ostscouts had been upgraded to the new variant; however it was soon discovered that both the Lyran Alliance and Word of Blake were fielding their own updated Ostscouts identical to ComStar's.

The addition of Triple Strength Myomer (and just enough heat sinks to keep the TSM active) also allows the 9R to inflict damage during the physical combat frequently encountered on Jihad battlefields.

The advanced structure and engine save a great deal of weight for weapons and equipment. The Perseus is protected by fourteen tons of Valiant Lamellor armor, giving it around average armor protection for a 'Mech of its size. It also has twelve double heat sinks that are fixed on the chassis.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.06.</color></b>",
      "content": "The Perseus is the product of a program begun by the League Central Coordination and Command to create an OmniMech completely indigenous to the Free Worlds League from concept to production. The Perseus shares much with the venerable Orion, a staple of Free Worlds League Military, both broadly resembling the older design visually and using a number of the same components. This similarity prompted more than a few FWLM technicians to nickname the new design the Omni-Orion and the deployment of Perseus has largely been to front-line units that fielded large concentrations of its progenitor, replacing older Orions on a one-for-one basis.

The Pouncer is built on a lightweight DSAM Endo 4 Endo Steel chassis and is powered by a 240 XL engine which gives it a maximum speed of 97.2 km/h. The 'Mech's mobility is enhanced with five Grandthrust Mk. Four jump jets that allow it to jump up to one hundred and fifty meters. For protection from enemy fire, the Pouncer has a respectable six tons of Forging ZM15 Ferro-Fibrous armor.

As with the other Celestials, the Preta was designed by Doctor Devon Cortland. Like the others, this 'Mech is full of brand new, 3069-era technology, featuring a C3i Computer and a small cockpit. It is built on a lightweight Endo Steel chassis and uses a light fusion engine for power. For protection, the Preta uses nine tons of standard armor.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 0.98.</color></b>",

      "content": "The Arctic Fox is a light OmniMech reverse engineered by the Kell Hounds from the Clan Uller OmniMech with assistance in the final stages from Clan Wolf-in-Exile. The resulting OmniMech is a powerful light 'Mech that has a top speed of 97.2 km/h that is provided by a GM 180 XL engine, shaving off valuable weight from the Arctic Fox's base chassis while also making the 'Mech vulnerable to becoming a combat kill through the loss of one of its side torsos. The Arctic Fox has ten double heat sinks which are generally enough to handle the 'Mech's heat load, with the ability to add more if needed.

Merryweather Industries was the first private company to attempt BattleMech production without governmental support. Despite their location in the Terran Hegemony, they acquired the plans to the Gladiator and produced a new run in 2490. They were unable to raise the capital to finish their second run, the 4R, and nearly went bankrupt before moving into IndustrialMechs. The GLD-4R production lines were closed down in 2495. A few salvaged Gladiator -1Rs were still in service with militaries across the Inner Sphere and Periphery, though these relics were finally pushed to extinction during the Reunification War. The 55-ton Gladiator has a top speed of 86 km/h, comparable to many other 'Mechs of the same weight. Nine and a half tons of armor provides a respectable amount of protection. Five jump jets enables the 'Mech to jump up to 150 meters at a time.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.05.</color></b>",

Like the Dominus variant, the Luminos can jump up to 150 meters using improved jump jets that enable it to get into a good sniping position. Three Medium Pulse Lasers and a Small Laser are used defensively in the event an enemy units gets inside the minimum range of the PPCs. A Flamer provides effective anti-infantry defense.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.1.</color></b>",
